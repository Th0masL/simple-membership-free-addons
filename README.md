# Simple Membership – Free Addons

## Installation

1. Download this repository as a ZIP (**Code → Download ZIP**) and extract it.
2. Pick the addon folder you want (for example, `swpm-partial-protection`) and compress that folder on its own into a ZIP file. Some addons are inside a group folder (for example, `01.CAPTCHA-related-addons-grp/swpm-recaptcha`): zip only the addon folder, not the group folder.
3. In your WordPress admin, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**, upload the ZIP and activate it.

   Or upload the addon folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` over FTP, then activate it from the **Plugins** menu.

Each addon's `readme.txt` has its changelog and any extra setup notes.
